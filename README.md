## Maths Problems

A small project which provides the user with an unlimited amount of randomly generated simple maths problems that can be solved in under a minute.

Once the timer has begun, the user can input an answer to each math problem that appears and submit it by pressing return.

The aim is to solve as many math problems in under a minute.
